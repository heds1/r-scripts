# R-scripts

These are some random R scripts that I haven't found a place for anywhere else.

- `compound-interest-shiny.R` is a little compound interest calculator for investing/retirement calculations

- `convert-nztm-to-lat-lon.R` is pretty well described by its filename

- `ggplot-tooltips.example.R` is not my code, but was borrowed to keep track of -- useful code for tooltips in ggplots

- `regression-interactions.Rmd` briefly talks about regression interactions in modelling

- `datasciencecoursera` is a collection of folders and files (notes, scripts, projects) pertaining to the Johns Hopkins University Data Science Specialization certificate I completed in 2020.
